Getting To Know Array Methods
Go to this link and look for the name of method to learn about it.

Write in your own way of understanding (don't copy paste)

Only if you are done with step 1 you should go ahead.

Practice it by yourself in console (2-3 times to understand)
Data types of parameters
Return value type
Write three examples
In your words what this method does.
Does it mutate the original value or not (check https://doesitmutate.xyz)
Example:

concat

Parameter: n (any) number of values (number, string, boolean, array, null, undefined, object and function etc)
Return: a single Array consisting of by all the values passed as parameters in the same order.
Example:
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.concat(4); //[1,2,3,4]
let sentanceArray = 'A quick brown fox jumped over a lazy'.split(' ');
sentanceArray.concat('dog').join(' '); //"A quick brown fox jumped over a lazy dog"
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
colors.concat('black', 'red', 21, true); // ['red','green','blue','black', 'red', 21, true]
concat accepts n number of values and returns one array with all the values in same order. It does not change the original array.
No it does not mutate the original array
